# ML Introduction Guides

This directory contains beginner-friendly guides for getting started with machine learning environments.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**New to ML?** Start here: [Getting Started Guide](00-getting-started.md)

## 📚 Guides

1. **[Getting Started](00-getting-started.md)** - Choose your ML environment
2. **[Google Colab](01-google-colab.md)** - Cloud-based development
3. **[Jupyter Notebook](02-jupyter.md)** - Local development
4. **[Python IDE](03-python.md)** - Professional development
5. **[First ML Example](04-first-ml-example.md)** - Hands-on tutorial
6. **[Next Steps](05-next-steps.md)** - Your learning roadmap

## 💻 Sample Files

- **[Colab Notebook](samples/colab-sample.ipynb)** - [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO/blob/main/introduction/samples/colab-sample.ipynb)
- **[Jupyter Notebook](samples/jupyter-sample.ipynb)** - Download for local use
- **[Python Script](samples/python-sample.py)** - IDE-friendly version

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

**Important**: After hosting this repository on GitHub, update the Colab links:

1. Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username
2. Replace `YOUR-REPO` with your repository name
3. The Colab links will then work directly from GitHub

Example: If your repo is `github.com/johndoe/ml-guides`, change:
```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO/blob/main/introduction/samples/colab-sample.ipynb
```
to:
```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/johndoe/ml-guides/blob/main/introduction/samples/colab-sample.ipynb
```

## 🎯 Learning Path

1. **Choose your environment** using the decision guide
2. **Set up your chosen tool** with the detailed guides
3. **Run your first ML model** with the sample files
4. **Continue learning** with the next steps guide

Happy learning! 🚀
