    "**Why Cross-Validation Matters:**\n",
    "- Single train/test split might be lucky or unlucky\n",
    "- Small datasets need every sample for both training and testing\n",

    "**When to Use Cross-Validation:**\n",
    "- Always for model selection and hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- When you have limited data (< 10,000 samples)\n",
    "- To compare multiple algorithms fairly\n",
