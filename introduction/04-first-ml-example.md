# Your First Machine Learning Model

**Goal:** Build a flower classifier that's 95%+ accurate  
**Time:** 10 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Environment set up (Colab, Jupyter, or Python IDE)

## Choose Your Sample

Pick the sample that matches your environment:

**Google Colab**: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CS-6140-ML-Fall-2025/TA-Classes/blob/main/introduction/samples/colab-sample.ipynb)

**Jupyter Notebook**: [Download jupyter-sample.ipynb](samples/jupyter-sample.ipynb)

**Python IDE**: [Download python-sample.py](samples/python-sample.py)

## What You'll Learn

- Load data from sklearn
- Split data for training/testing  
- Train a model
- Test model accuracy
- Make predictions on new data

## Next Steps

After completing your sample:
- Try different algorithms
- Work with your own datasets
