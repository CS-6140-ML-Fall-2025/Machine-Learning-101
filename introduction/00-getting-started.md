# Getting Started: Choose Your Environment

**Goal:** Pick the right tool to build your first ML model
**Time needed:** 5 minutes
**Prerequisites:** None!

## What You'll Build

In the next 30 minutes, you'll create your first machine learning model that predicts flower species with 95%+ accuracy.

The same code works in all environments - just pick the one that fits your situation.

## Quick Decision

**Want to start immediately?** → [Google Colab](01-google-colab.md) (no setup needed)

**Want to work offline?** → [JupyterLab](02-jupyter.md) (15 min setup)

**Want professional tools?** → [Python IDE](03-python.md) (30 min setup)

## Simple Comparison

**Google Colab**: Works in your browser, no setup, easy sharing
**JupyterLab**: Runs on your computer, works offline, modern interface  
**Python IDE**: Professional tools, advanced features, steeper learning curve

## What's Next?

Pick one and follow the setup guide:

1. **[Google Colab](01-google-colab.md)** - Start in 5 minutes
2. **[JupyterLab](02-jupyter.md)** - 15 minute setup
3. **[Python IDE](03-python.md)** - 30 minute setup

All three will teach you the same ML concepts - just pick what feels right for your situation.

## Can I Switch Later?

**Absolutely!** These environments work well together:

- Start with **Colab** for immediate gratification, then move to **JupyterLab** for local work
- Learn basics in **JupyterLab**, then transition to **Python IDE** for professional projects
- Use **Colab** for GPU-intensive work while doing daily development in **Jupyter**

The ML concepts and Python code you learn transfer completely between environments.

## Still Unsure?

**When in doubt, start with Google Colab.** It's the fastest way to see if you enjoy machine learning, and you can always explore other options later. The time investment is minimal, and you'll be running ML code within minutes.
