# Google Colab Setup

**Goal:** Get your first ML model running in 15 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Google account (Gmail, etc.)

## What is Colab?

- **Colab** is a free Jupyter notebook environment
- **Jupyter** is an open-source project for interactive data science and machine learning
- **Notebook** is a document that combines code, output, and text

## When to Choose Google Colab

**Perfect for you if:**
- You want to start ML immediately (no installation needed)
- You need free GPU power for training models
- You want to easily share your work with others
- You're comfortable working online
- You want to focus on learning, not setup

**Colab's superpowers:**
- **Zero setup** - works in any web browser
- **Free GPUs** - train models 10-100x faster than your laptop
- **Easy sharing** - send a link, others can run your code instantly
- **Pre-installed packages** - most ML libraries already available
- **Google Drive integration** - save your work automatically

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Access Colab
- Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Sign in with any Google account (Gmail, Google Workspace, etc.)
- No downloads or installations needed!

### 2. Create Your First Notebook
- Click **"New notebook"** or **File â†’ New notebook**
- Your notebook opens immediately - you're ready to code!
- Colab automatically saves to your Google Drive

### 3. Understanding the Interface
- **Code cells**: Where you write code (duh!)
- **Text cells**: For explanations and notes
- **Interface button**: Explore and get used to the interface, the buttons, help options, etc.

## Pro Tips for Beginners

### 1. Use Text Cells for Notes
Click **"+ Text"** to add explanations:
```markdown
# My ML Experiment
Today I learned how to:
- Load data with sklearn
- Train a Random Forest model
- Make predictions on new data

**Next steps**: Try different algorithms!
```

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts
- Keyboard shortcuts are available for faster productivity! Look for keyboard shortcut options in the interface when you're ready to speed up your workflow.

### 3. Get Help
```python
# Get help on any function
help(RandomForestClassifier)

# Or use ? for quick help
RandomForestClassifier?
```

## Next Steps

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've successfully:
- Created your first Colab notebook
- Trained a machine learning model
- Made predictions on new data
- Learned to share your work
