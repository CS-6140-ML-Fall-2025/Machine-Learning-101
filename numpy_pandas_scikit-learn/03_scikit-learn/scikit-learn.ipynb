    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Build and evaluate classification, regression, and clustering models\n",
    "- Master the complete ML pipeline from data to predictions\n",
    "- Apply preprocessing techniques and model evaluation metrics\n",
    "- Understand when to use different algorithms and how to tune them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:** Python basics, NumPy fundamentals, Pandas data preprocessing (complete previous notebooks first)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** ~90 minutes\n",

    "Scikit-learn is the go-to library for machine learning in Python. This notebook brings together everything you've learned in NumPy and Pandas to build actual ML models that can make predictions on real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Scikit-learn?** It provides:\n",
    "- Consistent API across all algorithms (fit, predict, score)\n",
    "- Built-in preprocessing tools that work seamlessly with Pandas\n",
    "- Comprehensive model evaluation and validation tools\n",
    "- Production-ready implementations of proven algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Path Connection:** This notebook uses:\n",
    "- **NumPy skills**: Array operations, mathematical functions, broadcasting\n",
    "- **Pandas skills**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, train/test splits\n",
    "- **New ML skills**: Model training, evaluation, and prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build:** Complete ML projects including customer classification, sales prediction, and customer segmentation - exactly what data scientists do every day!\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸŽ¯ Success Indicators:** By the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Train models and make accurate predictions on new data\n",
    "- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics\n",
    "- Choose the right algorithm for different types of problems\n",
    "- Build complete ML pipelines from raw data to final predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸ’¡ Beginner Tips:**\n",
    "- Start simple - basic models often work surprisingly well\n",
    "- Always split your data before training (never test on training data!)\n",
    "- Focus on understanding the problem before choosing algorithms\n",
    "- Model evaluation is as important as model training\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸ”— ML Problem Types We'll Cover:**\n",
    "- **Classification**: Predicting categories (premium vs regular customers)\n",
    "- **Regression**: Predicting numbers (sales amounts, prices)\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Finding hidden groups in data (customer segments)\n"
